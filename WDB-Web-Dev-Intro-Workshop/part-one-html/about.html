    <p> This new Macintosh has the brand new updated Motorola CPUs, which made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple 
        took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh 
        II at $5500, powered by a 16 MHz Motorola 68020 processor. The primary 
        improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version 
        of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many 
        innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, 
        any color depth, and multiple monitors.
